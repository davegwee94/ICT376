## Project Description

## Project Management
* Version control software (git) and a hosting service (eg github) will be used to maintain the 
project.
* So as to allow the group members to use the project code and resources independently 
of each other and for whatever purpose upon projects completion; the project will be licensed 
under a permissive free software license such as BSD or MIT.
* Each source file will contain a 
notice at top specifying initial author. The project will contain a file detailing work done by 
each group member, based on latest commit history ( lines changed / added) at project submission. 
* The project will be planned before starting, with each member having responsibility for an 
reasonably equal portion of the project.
* Each member will have a planned timeline, of when 
certain parts of the project should be completed by, with time for testing and review of each and 
the final whole project.

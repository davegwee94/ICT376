# ICT376 PROJECT GROUP CHARTER

## MEMBERS

* Kaito Kamiyama (31526732)

## Project Description
* An app that will merge contacts from various sources. The user will include or disclude sources 
such as sdcard, sim card, internal storage, etc, and choose which contacts to merge; or have 
likely merge candidates automatically selected. They will then be guided through any user input 
needed, such as choosing between conflicting information in a certain field; eg different 
addresses. The program will take automatic merge measures, such as names that are the same albeit 
with different capitalization. The user will be able to look at and manually change and fields. A 
common use would be merging duplicate contacts between a sim card and sd card (eg when switching 
to new phone) and produce a clean new list without duplicates.
* Potential names for app; cMerge, Contact Merger 

## Project Management
* Version control software (git) and a hosting service (eg github) will be used to maintain the 
project.
* So as to allow the group members to use the project code and resources independently 
of each other and for whatever purpose upon projects completion; the project will be licensed 
under a permissive free software license such as BSD or MIT.
* Each source file will contain a 
notice at top specifying initial author. The project will contain a file detailing work done by 
each group member, based on latest commit history ( lines changed / added) at project submission. 
* The project will be planned before starting, with each member having responsibility for an 
reasonably equal portion of the project.
* Each member will have a planned timeline, of when 
certain parts of the project should be completed by, with time for testing and review of each and 
the final whole project.
